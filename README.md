# Catalogs

`GSC2201/` — The 1.3 GB Hubble Guide Star Catalog 2.2.0.1,
which includes stars in the magnitude range 10.0–18.5.
Though traditionally installed at `/usr/local/xephem/catalogs/GSC2201`,
you can install the catalog anywhere
as long as you enter its path in the “GSC 2.2 Directory” field
in XEphem’s “Field Stars” window.
